    "\n",
    "The problem faced by the film production team is lack of knowledge about the key elements, without this knowledge they are at a higher risk to making a bad movie that does not fit the audience preferences leading to poor performance at the box office incurring the movie studio a huge loss.\n",
    "\n",
