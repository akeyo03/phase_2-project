# Strategic Movie Production Analysis

## Overview
Movie making is a wide source of revenue mainly in the entertainment industry compared to music and other forms of entertainment.
Many movies in hollywood and bollywood have grossed over 1 billion dollars world wide within months in a certain year due to the fact that movies have a very large audience world wide.
Some movie genres are popular than other movie genres based on the audience as different audience have their own different opinion and preferences to different genres.
Our aim is to navigate movies that rate high in the box office to find out what preference do most audiences prefer based on the genre of the film and its popularity to decide which films our movie studio could make.

## Goals 
### 1. Identify top-movies genres in the box office
This can be done by analyzing which movie genres are the most successful in the box office grossing a lot of money and its popularity among the audience.
### 2. Gather factors that make a movie be a success or popular
This can be done by investigating characteristics that contribute to top performing films.
Examining factors such as the movie budget, special effects used, storyline of the movie that engages the audience and the cast of the movie as some audience prefer watching movies with a popular cast and director.
### 3. Understand the market insights
Understand which movie genres are popular with which type of age group and gender as different audiences have different preferences. Example is child under the age 10 primarily girls would prefer to watch animated barbie movies.
### 4. Recommendations
1. Budget vs Revenue - Understand the relationship between the budget used to make the movies and the revenue received by the movie studio after the movie sales. We want to understand which aspect influences the other and how can it used by the stakeholders to make the movie studio a success.

2. Popularity vs Audience - Understand the relationship between popularity and the given audience. In the case popularity refers to how popular a certain film is and audience refers to the number of people who watch the certain films based on their popularity. We want to understand how the popularity of a film affects the number of people who go watch the certain films, and how it can be used by the movie studio stakeholders to make the movie studio succeed.

3. Rating - Understand of a rating of a movie influences the success of a movie. Rating of the movies are made by the audience and influence the number of people who watch the movies. We want to understand how this aspect can be used the stakeholders to make the movie studio a success.

4. Genres - This is the categories of movies which can either be romance action etc. Every audience have different preferences in terms of genres. As a movie we want to understand how different genres influence the success of a movie and with other aspects such as rating and popularity.

## Business Understanding
## Introduction
With the competitive edge in the entertainment industry, many companies are seeking in creating original video content  as popular way to secure audience attention and use it as a way of earning more revenue. 
Our company is interested into venturing to this dynamic market as it been seen and proven as a great source of income.
The real-life problem is that our organization is opening a new movie studio as a step into the film production industry. But we don't have the knowledge and understanding needed to make movies that will do well at the box office. This research attempts to study current box office statistics in order to determine the kinds of films that are doing the best in order to address this difficulty. Through the conversion of these insights into practical plans, we can direct the production of films that both connect with viewers and bring in a significant amount of money for our company's new film studio.
### Stakeholders

#### Company executives
Company executives provide insights and input on how the movie studio is to be managed. 
They provide strategic moves such as hiring of the intended staff such as directors and cast members of a certain movie.
They oversee the production of the movie in terms of budget required and as well as producers to ensure the movie is a success.
Another role is they approve which type of films to be produced and allocate resources to them.

Problem faced by company executives lack of market insight, company executives cannot approve production of a movie without knowing the intended market and what their needs and wants includes.

#### Marketing and sales teams 
A problem faced by marketing and sales teams is the ineffective  marketing and sales strategies.
Market and sales teams require a deep understanding of the audience preferences and market trends to develop a compelling campaign to promote the movies and increase revenue.
Without the knowledge, they incur a loss and money wastage in promoting the movie and lower return in revenue in the box-office.

By identifying which genre of movies gross a lot of money in the box office, marketing and sales teams identify the target market which is the audience depending on their prefernces and promote the movies to them increasing the chances of a successful film release.
From this, the movies end up grossing a lot of money in the box office.

#### Film production team 
The film production team are entrusted from the analysis of movies that generate the highest amount of money in the box office, to identify the key elements that make the successful.
The key elements could include a ceratin movie genre with its preferred audience, the movie rating, the cast of the movie, the stroyline of the movie and its popularity with the audience and the special effects used in the movie.
The film production could then adopt such ideas and create original video content from those elements.

The problem faced by the film production team is lack of knowledge about the key elements, without this knowledge they are at a higher risk to making a bad movie that does not fit the audience preferences leading to poor performance at the box office incurring the movie studio a huge loss.

#### Investors
Investors are a very important part in the movie making process as they provide financial aid that is essential with potential return on their investment. This encourages them to invest in more movies if the movies they invest in become huge successes.

Without the proper market analysis and reports about what the target audience may want, many investors may be hesistant in getting involved with the movie making limiting the movie studio financial resources.

#### Audience 
The audience are the main consumers in the entertainment industry. If they did not exist they wouldn't be an entertainment industry. 
With them been our main consumers it is important to understand their needs and wants.
This can be done by identify their preferences by placing them into different categories such as age, gender, hobbies and  probably occupation .
Giving an example, children under the age of 13 have a preference of watching animated films compared to crime documentary films.
Another example is male audience who love watching have a higher rate of watching sports-based films.
Through that the film studio is able to generate revenues from the movies through their audience.

With making of movies which do not resonate with them, it will be difficult to attract the audience to watch the movies leading to poor performance at the box office and a huge financial loss to the movie studio.

## Conclusion
The implications set by the project to the stakeholders include:
1. Through analysis and identifying the genres and characteristics of higher grossing films in the box office, the data derived from that provides easy decision making to the film production team who are able to meet the elements and provide film productions that satisfy consumer wants and generate revenue.
2. Company executives will be able to approve movies that meet the consumer wants and needs by allowing film production that meets the elements of grossing a high rating movie.
3. Market and sales teams will be able to design campigns that are attracting that draw in the audience as a way of promoting the movie.
4. Investors confidence will duue to the profit the studio is gaining and invest in more movie productions.
5. The audience will be able to watch and enjoy movies tailored to their needs and promote it by giving it a high rating.


## Data Understanding

 Its relevance is that it gives insights into budget and profitability, which are important for evaluating financial success.
### Justification for feature inclusion
From the analysis of the 6 datasets we decided to use 3 out of the 6 datasets.
These datasets include:
 - Dataset tmdb.movies.csv.gz
 - Dataset tn.movie_budgets.csv.gz
 -  Dataset im.db.zip
- These datasets contained the features needed for the analysis and understanding of our project.
These feature include:
- vote count and popularity - this feature is essential for this project as through vote count and rating we can be able to identify which films are popular among the audience this can be seen through database tmbd.movies.csv.gz
- Budget - This is essential for the project as it allows us to understand the relationship between production budget and revenue to know how much profit and loss the movie studio has incurred. This feature is found in the dataset tn.movie_budgets.csv.gz
- Revenue - It is the main indicator that shows us the financial success the movie has made or the financial loss the movie has made when it is compared to the budget. 
Revenue can be domestic gross which is revenue income from a certain region or country or world-wide gross which is revenue generated across the globe. This feature is found in the dataset tn.movie_budgets.csv.gz
- Genres - This feature enables us to identify which movie genre is popular and successful in the box office based on its average rating and number of votes made by the audience. This feature is found in the dataset im.db.zip

### Limitations
- Missing values - some features may contain missing values that may affect the analysis of the data.
- NAN values - Some key features in the dataset may contain NAN values that might reduce the accuracy of the analysis and may cause errors during analysis if not acted upon.

## Data Preparation
Under this section, we will go each chosen dataset and clean in preparation for analysis.

Cleaning of a dataset is very crucial to maintain accuracy as it removes errors and inconsistencies that may cause issues during analysis.

Another reason is to maintain consistency and efficiency of the data.

We would also want to maintain the integrity of our data.

Doing so, we will be looking mainly for missing values, NAN values, duplicate values and dropping unecessary columns that could affect our accuracy during analysis.

Pandas library will be used as tool to clean the selected datasets.

### Handling Missing values
In data preparation we handle missing values to maintain the integrity of our data, accuracy to ensure our data is not biased and consistency to make it easier for analysis.

In this subsection, missing values will be handled by:
- Identifying the number of missing values in each column of each dataset.

#### Identifying missing values in dataset tmdb.movies.csv.gz
Outcome shows dataset tmdb.movies.csv.gz has no missing values.

#### Identifying missing values in dataset tn.movie_budgets.csv.gz
Results shows dataset tn.movie_budgets.csv.gz has no missing values.

### Handling NAN Values
In this section we will be handling NAN values.

It is important to handle NAN values they reduce data quality indicating missing values, affect statistical analysis such as mean and standard deviation which is important during the analysis stage of this project.

It also affects visualization which is an important aspect of this project as they lead to misleading and incomplete visualizations.

The NAN values will be handled by:
- Calculating the percentage of NAN values for each column in each selected dataset.

#### Calculating the percentage of NAN values for each column in dataset tmdb.movies.csv.gz
The dataset tmbd.movies.csv.gz has no NAN values

#### Calculating the percentage of NAN values for each column in dataset tn.movie_budgets.csv.gz
The dataset tn.movies_budgets.csv.gz has no NAN values.

### Handling NULL Values
Since we have database, it is important to check if the database ha NULL values.
We check for NULL values to maintain data integrity as NuLL values indicate incomplete or missing values.
Maintain accuracy during analysis as NULL values affect accuracy of a model.

#### Checking for NULL values in the database im.db.zip
From the codes above it shows our column movie_id, primary_title and start_year do not have null values, but our main column of focus genres has null values.

To handle null values in column genres we will delete the rows that have null values.
From the codes above columns average rating and numvotes from table movie_rating do not have null values.

### Handling Duplicated values
We handle duplicated values to maintain accuracy during analysis especially during statistical analysis of means, variances and standard deviatiom.
We also handle duplicates to maintain data consistency and integrity.

#### Checking for duplicated values in dataset tmdb.movies.csv.gz
Outcome is that dataset tmdb.movies.csv.gz has no duplicated values.

##### Checking for duplicated values in dataset tn.movie_budgets.csv.gz
Outcome shows that dataset tn.movie_budgets.csv.gz has no duplicated values.

## Data Analysis
In this section we will be applying statistical measures and logical techniques to evaluate and analyze data.

The chosen datasets specific for this project include tn.movie_budgets.csv.gz, tmdb.movies.csv.gz and database im.db.zip.

Each of these datasets will be analyzed through various methods such as hypothesis testing and linear regression.

Our recommendations in this case is what we stated under our goals, to help understand and implement ways in which each stakeholder can take the movie studio a successs.

Our findings will be the results achieved after analysis.

These methods will help us create findings to our business problem and use our analysis and findings as recommendations to our business problem.

We will also be able to explain why our findings support our recommendations and how the recommendations will help the new movie studio succeed.

### Methods
#### 1. Hypothesis testing 
This is one of the methods that will be used for analysis. Under hypothesis testing, we will be able to analyze each of the datasets to achieve our findings. The findings will be used to explain why it supports our recommendations.

In hypothesis testing, we will be defining the null and alternative hypothesis of each of the datasets and concluding if we are able to reject the null hypothesis or if we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

Statistical tests such as t_tests, correlation will be used with, p-values and alpha values will be used to help us either reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.

The analysis will be either one-tailed or two-tailed depending on the specific finding.

We will be using an alpha value of 0.05.

##### 1. Dataset tmdb.movies.csv.gz
Bugdet vs Revenue is one of our recommendations as listed in our business understanding as way of making our movie studio succeed.

Revenue is divided into domestic gross and worldwide gross. These types of revenue generated depends on the production budget used by the movie studio.

The production budget used by the movie studio is used by the film and production team to make the movie that fits the audience requirements.

The production budget is approved by the company executives and provided by the investors.

This dataset has three specific columns that we will be using that is production budget, domestic gross and worldwide gross, we will be using these columns to generate both null and alternative hypothesis to see if production budget is associated with domestic gross and worldwide gross.

###### Null and Alternative Hypothesis
- Null Hypothesis (Ho)

The null hypothesis generated between production budget and domestic gross is that there is no relationship between production budget of a movie and the domestic gross generated.

This means that changes in production budget whether a high production or not is not associated with the domestic gross generated.

The null hypothesis generated between production budget and worldwide gross is that there is no relationship between production budget of a movie and the worldwide gross generated.

This means that changes in production budget whether a high production or not is not associated with the worldwide gross generated.

- Alternative Hypothesis (H1)

The alternative hypothesis generated between production budget and domestic gross is that there is a significant relationship between production budget of a movie and the domestic gross generated.

The alternative hypothesis generated between production budget and domestic gross is that there is a significant relationship between production budget of a movie and the domestic gross generated.

This means that changes in production budget whether a high production or not is associated with the domestic gross generated.

The alternative hypothesis generated between production budget and domestic gross is that there is a significant relationship between production budget of a movie and the worldwide gross generated.

This means that changes in production budget whether a high production or not is associated with the worldwide gross generated.

To get our findings we will use pearson correlation to generate the correlation and the p-value. So that we can be able to either reject or fail to reject our null hypothesis.

##### Results
From the analysis, the findings achieved shows that we reject the null hypothesis with significance to the alpha value since the p-value is 1.8046848891196828e-22 less the than the alpha value 0.05. Between domestic gross and production budget.

For worldwide gross and production budget, the findings achieved shows that we reject the null hypothesis with significance to the alpha value since the p-value is 4.7264202307731374e-138,

In conclusion we do accept there is a relationship between domestic gross and production budget.

In conclusion we do accept there is a relationship between worldwide gross and production budget.

Our findings supports our recommendations which is budget vs revenue such that some films with high production budgets tend to generate a lot revenue in terms of domestic gross and world wide gross as shown in the visualizations above,  but sometimes that does not seem to be the case as some of them with high production budget generate low revenue compared to other movies with low production due to some factors such as popularity of the film and marketing of the film.

For my recommendations which is revenue, i would suggest to the movie studio to invest in the production budget for the film and production team  of a film, as low production budgets leads to low return in revenue in terms of domestic gross and worldwide gross. Investing money to the production budget will lead to high return in revenue in terms of domestic gross and world wide gross.
