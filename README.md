## Business Understanding
## Introduction
With the competitive edge in the entertainment industry, many companies are seeking in creating original video content  as popular way to secure audience attention and use it as a way of earning more revenue. 
Our company is interested into venturing to this dynamic market as it been seen and proven as a great source of income.
The real-life problem is that our organization is opening a new movie studio as a step into the film production industry. But we don't have the knowledge and understanding needed to make movies that will do well at the box office. This research attempts to study current box office statistics in order to determine the kinds of films that are doing the best in order to address this difficulty. Through the conversion of these insights into practical plans, we can direct the production of films that both connect with viewers and bring in a significant amount of money for our company's new film studio.
### Stakeholders

#### Company executives
Company executives provide insights and input on how the movie studio is to be managed. 
They provide strategic moves such as hiring of the intended staff such as directors and cast members of a certain movie.
They oversee the production of the movie in terms of budget required and as well as producers to ensure the movie is a success.
Another role is they approve which type of films to be produced and allocate resources to them.

Problem faced by company executives lack of market insight, company executives cannot approve production of a movie without knowing the intended market and what their needs and wants includes.

#### Marketing and sales teams 
A problem faced by marketing and sales teams is the ineffective  marketing and sales strategies.
Market and sales teams require a deep understanding of the audience preferences and market trends to develop a compelling campaign to promote the movies and increase revenue.
Without the knowledge, they incur a loss and money wastage in promoting the movie and lower return in revenue in the box-office.

By identifying which genre of movies gross a lot of money in the box office, marketing and sales teams identify the target market which is the audience depending on their prefernces and promote the movies to them increasing the chances of a successful film release.
From this, the movies end up grossing a lot of money in the box office.

#### Film production team 
The film production team are entrusted from the analysis of movies that generate the highest amount of money in the box office, to identify the key elements that make the successful.
The key elements could include a ceratin movie genre with its preferred audience, the movie rating, the cast of the movie, the stroyline of the movie and its popularity with the audience and the special effects used in the movie.
The film production could then adopt such ideas and create original video content from those elements.

The problem faced by the film production team is lack of knowledge about the key elements, without this knowledge they are at a higher risk to making a bad movie that does not fit the audience preferences leading to poor performance at the box office incurring the movie studio a huge loss.

#### Investors
Investors are a very important part in the movie making process as they provide financial aid that is essential with potential return on their investment. This encourages them to invest in more movies if the movies they invest in become huge successes.

Without the proper market analysis and reports about what the target audience may want, many investors may be hesistant in getting involved with the movie making limiting the movie studio financial resources.

#### Audience 
The audience are the main consumers in the entertainment industry. If they did not exist they wouldn't be an entertainment industry. 
With them been our main consumers it is important to understand their needs and wants.
This can be done by identify their preferences by placing them into different categories such as age, gender, hobbies and  probably occupation .
Giving an example, children under the age of 13 have a preference of watching animated films compared to crime documentary films.
Another example is male audience who love watching have a higher rate of watching sports-based films.
Through that the film studio is able to generate revenues from the movies through their audience.

With making of movies which do not resonate with them, it will be difficult to attract the audience to watch the movies leading to poor performance at the box office and a huge financial loss to the movie studio.
